### Hi there 👋

• 😁 This is Yuxi and welcome to my Github!

• 👩‍🎓 I’m a marketing and supply chain background turning data scientist.

•📓 I am extremely interested in real life topics like retails, finance, supply chain and health care! In my capstone of bootcamp, I used machine learning to develop a model that quantifies the relative advantage of buying vs. waiting to purchase common consumer electronics. You can find my Jupyter notebook with codes and slides of project on this Github page.

• 💃 In my free time I enjoy yoga, reading and exploring new hiking places.

• 📬 If you are interested in connecting, you can reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuxicong/) or by email @ yuxicongcareers@gmail.com
